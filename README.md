# psc-ide-vim

Work in progress!

You can get it to work already by:
0. Installing the plugin via Vundle/NeoBundle: frigoeu/psc-ide-vim
1. Running psc-ide-server in the root directory of your project yourself
2. Calling :PSCload when in the file you're editing
3. Calling :PSCtype will give you the type of the identifier under the cursor
4. Omnicompletion should work with the above steps

Big todo's: 
1. Start psc-ide-server myself when entering a purescript project
2. Calling :PSCload myself when entering a purescript file, + recompiling(?)/reloading after a succesful save
